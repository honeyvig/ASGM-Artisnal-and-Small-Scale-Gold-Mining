# ASGM-Artisnal-and-Small-Scale-Gold-Mining
automating the organization and analysis of information related to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the Amazon, we will go through the key phases step-by-step, writing Python code to implement each component.
Overview of Key Phases:

    Email Content Ingestion: Integrate with Gmail to extract and clean content.
    Data Processing: Extract text from PDFs, scrape webpages, and analyze with OpenAI GPT.
    Knowledge Base Management: Organize the extracted data into a structured format.
    User-Friendly Chatbot: Build an interactive interface to query the knowledge base.
    Systems Map Integration: Export structured data to Kumu.io for systems mapping.

Let’s break it down with Python code for each phase.
Phase 1: Email Content Ingestion
1.1 Set Up Gmail Integration

Use the Gmail API to monitor the inbox and process incoming content.

To interact with Gmail, first, you'll need to set up the Gmail API, which involves creating a project in the Google Developer Console and getting the necessary credentials. Follow these steps:

    Go to Google Developer Console.
    Create a project.
    Enable the Gmail API.
    Create OAuth credentials and download the credentials.json file.

Then, use the Python google-api-python-client library to access Gmail.

First, install the required libraries:

pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

Here’s the Python code to authenticate and fetch emails:

import os
import base64
import json
import re
import time
import pickle
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# Set up the Gmail API
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly']
CREDENTIALS_FILE = 'credentials.json'
TOKEN_PICKLE = 'token.pickle'

def authenticate_gmail_api():
    """Authenticate and return the Gmail API service."""
    creds = None
    if os.path.exists(TOKEN_PICKLE):
        with open(TOKEN_PICKLE, 'rb') as token:
            creds = pickle.load(token)
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(CREDENTIALS_FILE, SCOPES)
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
        with open(TOKEN_PICKLE, 'wb') as token:
            pickle.dump(creds, token)
    service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=creds)
    return service

def get_emails(service, query=""):
    """Get emails from Gmail inbox based on a search query."""
    results = service.users().messages().list(userId='me', q=query).execute()
    messages = results.get('messages', [])
    
    email_data = []
    for message in messages:
        msg = service.users().messages().get(userId='me', id=message['id']).execute()
        email_data.append(msg)
    
    return email_data

def extract_email_content(email_data):
    """Extract clean email content from the email messages."""
    cleaned_emails = []
    for msg in email_data:
        payload = msg['payload']
        headers = payload['headers']
        
        # Extract subject, sender, and body
        subject = next(item for item in headers if item['name'] == 'Subject')['value']
        sender = next(item for item in headers if item['name'] == 'From')['value']
        body = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(payload['body']['data']).decode('utf-8') if 'body' in payload else ''
        
        cleaned_emails.append({
            'subject': subject,
            'sender': sender,
            'body': body
        })
    
    return cleaned_emails

# Example usage:
service = authenticate_gmail_api()
email_data = get_emails(service, query="ASGM")  # Customize the query based on your needs
emails = extract_email_content(email_data)
print(emails)

Phase 2: Data Processing
2.1 Automate Content Analysis

For PDFs and webpages, you can use tools like pdfplumber for PDFs and BeautifulSoup or Diffbot for webpage scraping.
Extract Text from PDFs:

pip install pdfplumber

import pdfplumber

def extract_pdf_text(pdf_path):
    """Extract text from a PDF file."""
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        text = ""
        for page in pdf.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
    return text

# Example usage
pdf_text = extract_pdf_text("path_to_your_pdf.pdf")
print(pdf_text[:500])  # Print first 500 characters

Web Scraping (Using BeautifulSoup):

pip install beautifulsoup4 requests

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_webpage(url):
    """Scrape and clean webpage content."""
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Get the text content from paragraphs
    paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
    text = ' '.join([para.get_text() for para in paragraphs])
    return text

# Example usage
webpage_text = scrape_webpage("https://example.com/your-article")
print(webpage_text[:500])  # Print first 500 characters

Send Content to OpenAI GPT for Summarization:

pip install openai

import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'

def summarize_with_gpt(text):
    """Use OpenAI GPT to summarize content."""
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003", 
        prompt=f"Summarize the following content:\n\n{text}", 
        temperature=0.7, 
        max_tokens=200
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage:
summary = summarize_with_gpt(pdf_text)
print(summary)

Phase 3: Knowledge Base Management

You can store your data in a structured format using a JSON or a database like Airtable or Google Sheets. Here's how you can create a structured JSON file for knowledge management:

import json

def save_to_json(data, filename="knowledge_base.json"):
    """Save structured data to a JSON file."""
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=4)

# Example usage
knowledge_base = []
knowledge_base.append({
    "name": "John Doe",
    "organization": "Gold Mining Org",
    "role": "Coordinator",
    "country": "Brazil",
    "expertise": "ASGM policy",
    "keywords": ["gold mining", "sustainability"]
})

save_to_json(knowledge_base)

Phase 4: User-Friendly Chatbot

For building a simple chatbot, you can use Streamlit for a quick interface or Flask for a more customizable solution.
Using Streamlit to Create a Chatbot Interface:

pip install streamlit

import streamlit as st

def chatbot_response(user_input):
    """Generate a response based on user input."""
    # Here, integrate GPT for dynamic responses
    response = summarize_with_gpt(user_input)  # Placeholder GPT response
    return response

# Streamlit UI
st.title("ASGM Chatbot")
user_input = st.text_input("Ask a question:")
if user_input:
    answer = chatbot_response(user_input)
    st.write(answer)

To run the Streamlit app, just run:

streamlit run your_script.py

Phase 5: Systems Map Integration (Kumu.io)

To export the data to Kumu.io, you can use CSV format or Kumu.io’s API to update the map programmatically.

Here’s a basic example to export data to CSV:

import csv

def export_to_csv(data, filename="systems_map.csv"):
    """Export knowledge base data to CSV for Kumu.io."""
    fieldnames = data[0].keys()  # Use keys of the first record as headers
    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()
        for row in data:
            writer.writerow(row)

# Example usage:
export_to_csv(knowledge_base)

For more advanced integration with Kumu.io, you can use Kumu's API to push data directly into the platform.
Conclusion

This system combines email content ingestion, data processing, and AI-powered chatbot functionality. The user interacts with a web interface (Streamlit or Flask), which queries a knowledge base populated with extracted and summarized data from emails, PDFs, and webpages. The system is designed to allow users to ask questions and retrieve insights without technical skills.

With the Gmail integration, content analysis, and summarization, this system will automate the processing of relevant ASGM data. The integration with Kumu.io will allow you to visualize the relationships in a systems map.
